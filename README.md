## Overview

This project is a solution to the Recipe Page challenge from Frontend Mentor.
The goal was to build a clean, responsive recipe layout that closely matches the provided design using only HTML and CSS. The focus was on typography, spacing, and responsive behavior across different screen sizes.

## The-Challenge

The challenge was to:

Build a responsive recipe page that adapts well to mobile and desktop screens
Match the provided design as closely as possible
Use semantic HTML elements for better structure and accessibility
Apply consistent spacing, typography, and color styling
Ensure the layout remains clean and readable on all screen sizes

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I practiced building a mobile-first layout and handling edge-to-edge designs without breaking spacing or typography.  
I also learned how to style lists, manage spacing using margins instead of container padding, and debug browser-specific rendering differences during responsive testing.

### Continued development

In future projects, I want to:

- Improve CSS organization and reusability
- Explore accessibility best practices
- Build more Frontend Mentor challenges to strengthen layout and responsive design skills
